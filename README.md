`AMCoreAudio` is an Objective-C wrapper for [Apple's Core Audio](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/) framework focusing on:

- Simplifying audio device enumeration
- Providing accessors for the most relevant audio device properties (i.e., device name, device manufacturer, device UID, volume, mute, sample rate, clock source, etc.)
- Subscribing to system and audio device specific notifications using the delegate pattern.

`AMCoreAudio` is currently powering [AudioMate](http://audiomateapp.com) (recently open-sourced and available at https://github.com/The9Labs/AudioMate).
